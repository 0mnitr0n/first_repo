1. Need to build a DM version of the battle map
    a. DM version will have NPCs that are not visible to the players
2. Need to have both player map and DM map sync in realtime
3. Need a way to hide NPCs from players
4. Maybe add a resize feature for the grid and icons?
5. Create a battle map maker
6. When a player is down, make a way to show it- like right click and "knock player out" and then "wake player up"
7. When a player is double tapped it makes a ping animation on both the DM and the player sites
9. Need a way to keep track of armor classes and health of enemies - puts a little floating number over the players and npcs
    a. probably for DMs only. keeping track of all the monsters is important and enable horde based combat where it is difficult to track for DMs
10. will build 2 accounts freebee (players only ) - DM (paid account) can create campaigns and battle maps and can invite other accounts into campaigns
    a. possible have guest monster appearances from hosted NPCS that can be imported into other campaigns
    b. this will require the concept of a guest DM that will be able to import his monster into the host DMs campaign
    c. like have monster builder that you can import or export to other campaigns
    d. usually this would be temporary for this one encounter - highlights the socialization of DnD and enables the people to make new friends

11. Keep track of NPC kills
