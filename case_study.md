Challenge:
1. I need a way to run the non-verbal aspect of campaigns(display images, show stat blocks, etc) for people over long distances
    features required: 

        1. a way to display images of monsters, landscapes, maps, characters, stats and text that can be easily looked back upon as need requires

        2. a way to whitelist specific pieces of information(stat blocks, for example) from being visible depending on role or the specific individual, as well as ease of changing the accessibility of the information as certain info is able to be accessed until, for example, the party leaves an area, loses papers, or splits off from one another, requiring info to be whitelisted and made visible quickly. 

        3. a private record of outlines(rough draughts), timelines and descision trees, able to be updated as the campaign progresses

        4. a easily updated record of character sheets, able to be edited by both player and game master, as well as a timeline of edits made to the character(inventory history)

        5. the ability to assign multiple roles to individuals with certain privledges corresponding to a role

        6. a way to write and record text onto "pages" with a text editor, and to create hyperlinks on these "pages to other "pages" for ease of accessing related information, for example, the records that contain information on a character would contain a hyperlink to the records of another character they have interacted with, the records of the region they are from, or the records of the items they possess

        7. a way to organize infomation into catagories, and in those catagories to contain sub-catagories, and in those sub-catacories to contain sub-sub catagories, etc. For example, a catagory of records that is devoted to characters, sub-catagories would be player characters and non-player characters, and sub-sub catagories of the non-player charater catagory would be allies, antagonists, and neutral characters
